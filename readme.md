# Automated Tests for the saucedemo.com Website Using Java + Selenium

I have written automated tests for the [saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com) website as part of practicing automated testing. These tests cover functionalities such as login, order flow, and UI testing. The tests are continuously evolving and will be further developed over time.
